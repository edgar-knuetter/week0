Explain what each of the following lines does. Use the terminology you learned from the book (or Google)

	from TurtleWorld import *
	world = TurtleWorld()
	bob = Turtle()
	wait_for_user()

Answer:
The first line imports all (*) of the TurtleWorld module.
The second line assigns the function TurtleWorld() to world
The third line assigns the function Turtle() to bob
The fourth line calls the function wait_for_user





These questions pertain to the program you wrote in Week0.

-- What are the arguments of polygon()?  What type is each argument?
Answer:
bob: function
30: integer
6: integer

-- What two turtle functions did you use to draw the sides of the polygon?
Answer: fd() and lt()

-- What are the arguments for polyline?  What type is each argument?
Answer: for polygon() the polyline arguments were
bob: function
30: integer
6: integer
60.0: float




Suppose you wrote a function, center_circle(), that draws a circle of a given radius around the current location of the turtle and restores the turtle to its starting point.

-- What turtle functions would you use to move the turtle from the center to the edge of the circle and get ready to call the original circle() function?
Answer: pu(), fd(), lt(), pd()

-- Suppose the interface of this function requires the turtle to end up in the same place it started, facing in the same direction it started.
Answer: pu(), lt(), fd()

-- What is this type of requirement called?
Answer: postcondition
